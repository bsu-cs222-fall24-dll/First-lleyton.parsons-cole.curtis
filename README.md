The 5 warnings in WikipediaReader.java are all warnings about depreciated methods including URLS. Numerous spelling check errors are present as well, but are part of URL links used in the code.

Instructions: After running the program, input the name of a Wikipedia article that you wish to see the latest 15 revisions of, with timestamps and usernames, which are all viewable in the console. 

Our project prompts the user for the name of the Wikipedia article they wish to see the revisions on. Afterwards, our program prints out the 15 latest revisions of said article. If the user does not put in an article name for input, an appropriate error message is displayed. Same applies for network errors and searching for Wikipedia articles that do not exist. Test classes include a formatOutput error checking, WikipediaReader, ErrorParser.
